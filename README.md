# SVM-on-MNIST-dataset
It uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) model created from scratch to predict handwritten digits.

As this is a multi-class classification problem, so there are two ways in which it can be solved using multiple binary classifiers:-
1. One Vs One Classification
2. One Vs Rest Classification

So I have created two different SVM models from scratch for both these approaches.

And the accuracy of these models comes out to be as follows:-
1. One Vs One Classification Model :-
      <br>Training Accuracy  :   91.16%  
       Testing Accuracy   :   90.52%
      
2. One Vs Rest Classification Model :-
      <br>Training Accuracy  :   88.77%
      <br>Testing Accuracy   :   87.61%
